[case]
description = One of the form types is "SC/10".
    When using the C CLI, this results in a file "SC-10.csv".
    When using the Python `parse_as_files()` this results in "SC/10.csv".
    When using the Python `parse()` the form type returned in a line
    of the output is "SC/10".
    We need to decide which is correct and make the others consistent.
x_fail = True
x_fail_reason = Form type "SC/10" is parsed inconsistently
